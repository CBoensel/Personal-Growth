# Normal Accidents

This is a rabbit hole I went down in 2016/17.  There are a lot of interesting books out there, and I tend to read a decent amount, and I don't remember where, but there was a recommendation for [Charles Perrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Perrow)'s [Normal Accidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_Accidents).  I was hooked, because I saw the parallels in the complexity of large software systems with the complexity of other tightly coupled, complex systems.


# Presentations
Here are two versions of the PPT presentation.  I made them because I was presenting them, so they don't have the complete notes, but hopefully they stand on their own to some degree.
