# Personal Growth

The beginnings of my open-sourced personal growth sources and musings.  For now it consists of a few documents.

> *Note*:  If you're reading this via straight Github, it is also now available in an easier to read format at [jotpowers.github.io](https://jotpowers.github.io/).  This is as a result of Vidit opening [this issue](https://github.com/jotpowers/College-Grads/issues/1). If you're reading this via Github Pages, then the bare repo is available [here](https://github.com/jotpowers/Personal-Growth).

* [Podcasts](podcasts.md) - Podcast list with in-depth list of specific episodes I think are interesting.
