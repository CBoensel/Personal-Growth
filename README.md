# Personal Growth

The beginnings of my open-sourced personal growth sources and musings.  For now it consists of a few documents.

* [Books](books.md) - Curated book list.  The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.
* [Podcasts](podcasts.md) - Podcast list with in-depth list of specific episodes I think are interesting.
* [Career Development Planning discussion](CareerDevelopment-Planning.md) - My document on how I approach CDP.  May or may not work for you.
* [Becoming a Manager](on-becoming-a-manager.md) - My thoughts on transitioning from technologist to manager.
* [Decision Making](decision-making.md) - Evolution and process for tracking and improving my (and in theory, your) decision making.
