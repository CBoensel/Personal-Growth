# Personal Growth

The beginnings of my open-sourced personal growth sources and musings.  For now it consists of a few documents.

* [Books](books.md) - Curated book list.  The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.
* [Podcasts](podcasts.md) - Podcast list with in-depth list of specific episodes I think are interesting.
* [Career Development Planning discussion](CareerDevelopment-Planning.md) - My document on how I approach CDP.  May or may not work for you.
