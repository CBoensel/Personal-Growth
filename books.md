# Book list

The number of self-help/business books out there is overwhelming.  This is the list of the ones I think are important.  If you disagree with this list, that's great, it just means we're not aligned on preferences/views.  In that case, the list of books I actively dislike, might be useful to you.

Most of these I actually read.  As in, viewed the words.  This is because, for most books, audiobooks just don't work for me.  Especially for business books, where this is the pattern:

1. Have an interesting point/perspective
2. Have an example
3. Have another example
4. How about an example with your example

This kills me. Even at 2X they go too slow. I think *Team of Teams* was 12+ hours.  Even at 2x that's 6+ hours.  In "physical" books (which I scare quote because I actually read almost all of them electronically) I can just skip through the next N sections skimming.  I can't do the same with audiobooks. (It turns out that this is probably actually due to the way books expenses work/compensation works.  Authors end up having to write ~200 pages, so you have a lot of filler).

# Audiobooks

"What the hell?", you say.  I thought you said you couldn't listen to audiobooks.  Generally, that's true.  But there are a few that I've been able to listen to.  Maybe worth it.  Maybe not.

* The Three Signs of a Miserable Job - Patrick Lencioni

   It really helps that this is a fable about leadership and business, instead of simply a book.  This is the first audiobook I've listened too that I thought was informative and entertaining.

* Bad Blood - John Carreyrou

   Damn, this is a hard listen.  It's tough listening to chapter after chapter of horrible behaviors and decisions.  I could only stomach about 30 minutes at a time.  Still, well written and a great cautionary tale.  I think most of the things I took from this just reinforced my biases.  
   * Make sure you do things you can sleep with at night.  If you're not sure, don't do it.
   * Force of personality and charisma can achieve amazing things.  If it's not backed with integrity, it is actively harmful.
   * Bullies can win, but only if you let them.  Might not be true in the rest of the world, but is in the U.S.
