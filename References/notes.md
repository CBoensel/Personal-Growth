# Various info that is interesting to me, but not generally interesting

<a name="1">1.</a> How did I come up with that number?  The book was released in 2015, and it's shockingly hard to find total number of sales for an individual book.  I'm sure the authors know, since they get paid based on that.  But still, I found [some data](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/78257-print-unit-sales-up-in-2018-to-date.html) showing that January to September of 2018 there were 476,676,000 books sold.  The precision of the numbers is going to lead us astray, so I'll multiple 1.33 (to cover the rest of the year) and round up to 700,000,000 to cover a surge in holidays.  This represents a 2.5% increase over 2017, but let's set an upper bound.  If we assume 700,000,000 books a year from 2015 (publication date) and today we're at 2.8B books.  Now, in 2018 206,312,000 were adult non-fiction, which is where our book fits.  This represents 43% of total sales.  Now, sadly our book doesn't make the top 50 of most important business books, but Amazon has it as #25 in Business Planning & Forecasting, and #30,063 overall.  Now, we're going to assume Amazon has a big enough sample size to smooth out anomalies.  This is already going too long, so we're going to make a poor choice and say, worst case, upper bound, that all of the top 30,000 books over 4 years sell the same amount.  This is probably grossly wrong, as I expect the 80/20 rule to come into effect.  If we take 2.8 billion / 30k we're at 93000 per place.  So, for the 4 years that puts us at 360,000 copies.  Now, we could do more work, but if we go with a US population of [327 million for 2018](https://www.census.gov/popclock/) means we get a 1.14 percent chance that someone has read the book.  Close enough to 2% that I'm pretty confident of my 98% number being the maximum.  99% would probably be a better approximation.

<a name="2">2.</a> Ok, there are a few cases I can imagine.  The first is that an organization has a group they intend to jettison.  The existing manager was fired/left and they need someone to fill that role so they don't have to worry about it while the figure out strategy, where they know this group won't exist anymore.  Safe to say, you don't want to be in that role.  Second, you have a leader who is incompetent.  This one you can figure out.  Look who they have made managers in the past, and how successful they've been.  If that hasn't worked out on more than one occasion, recognize a few things.  First, they're bad at this.  Second, you're in a bad position.  Third, they're unlikely to be there long-term.

<a name="3">3.</a> These are my more detailed notes for this podcast.  I wrote them out, but they're too long for the podcast page itself, but I think I'll still want to reference them, so including them here.

  * Simplify.  Simplify.  Simplify.
  * Heuristic around transaction cost:  Money.  Time.  Effort.  Cleanest way to setup a business to to reduce that transaction cost.
  * Discussion on "float".  How can you use money you have today to fund your business tomorrow.
  * Preference of of repurchase over dividend.  I think this is a key discussion.  Do you have discipline in understanding what the impact to your shareholders is, or not?  Simple answer is not the correct answer.
  * Management style:
    * Hire great people
    * Surround yourself with great people
    * Delegate to those people
    * Give people autonomy
    * People get more job satisfaction if they can make decisions in their domain
  * What to do as a leader:
    * At the beginning I'm doing everything:  programming, hiring the leaders, doing the ad copy
    * But quickly you need to realize your goals are to build an major enterprise, and to do that you have to hire a team.
      * Step out of "how do you do that"
      * Learn as a leader how do you grow?  How do you handle acquisitions?  How do you do business abroad?
  * Basic style is still the same:
      * Hire great people
      * Delegate
  * What are common traits you look for in hiring?
    * Single most important thing you do
    * Grow talent from within
    * People who like to learn
    * Demonstrated record of success.  There are a lot of bright people who are idle.
  * Look at Grit by Angela Duckworth
  * Are there negative screens?
    * Job hoppers.  People who don't stick with things over 18 months.
  * Innovation is never the job of one organization
  * Be willing to say "No."
    * You need to realize that as you move on in life, you want to help, but by doing one thing you can not do another.
    * People are generally pretty receptive to it, as long as you are thoughtful about it.
    * Be protective of your time.
    * Don't try to satisfy all comers.
