## The Best Career Advice I've Ever Gotten

"Find someone you trust.  Work on something important to them."  - Yannick Bercy (RIP)

## Feedback is a Gift

At some point in your career you've heard that.  And, it's true, but not in the way you might think.

It's a gift, because you can not buy it, it has to be earned.  Think about the best gifts that you have ever given or received.  Rarely are they the most expensive, but they are the ones that show the most thought and caring.  Generally they are great because they are unexpected and thoughtful.

When I truly give the gift of feedback, I'm making myself vulnerable to your disappointment, but only because I believe you have earned that trust.  If you have not, then you can't truly expect to get a meaningful gift.  The best you can hope for is an entertaining Secret Santa gift.

I've given feedback in the past where it wasn't earned.  It just creates resentfulness.

Earn the gift.  Give the gift carefully.
